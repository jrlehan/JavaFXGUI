It needs to be clear on which functions print immediately, which return a value, and which sort thew result in another collection.

For example:


I'm trying to finish the java project and am a little confused about these last functions. For each user input, say the user invokes is_present() or something, should the sample printout on the document be printed immediately or only be printed when the user then calls print_query_list() and print_count()?  
Part of my confusion is because the query may be of different types, maybe an ArrayList or boolean value, thus I'm not 100% sure how to deal with it.

Great question. The result shouldÂ be held until the "print" functions do exactly that. You are correct, there will be different "result holders" that you will need to use.
